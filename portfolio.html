	<h2>Rover Data</h2>
	    <img src="Graphs.PNG" height="300" alt="Best guess of what the graphs represent">
	    <p>After sorting the data, we converted the data into graphs and later tried to hypothesize what each graph represents.<br>We reasoned that a graph that remained at a low level then has a sudden jump up would fit with a temperature level that quickly rises in the day.</p>
	    <p>We also resoned that a graph that has a sudden dip in the middle could fit with a region that has intense light that is occasionally blocked out by clouds and a graph that varied a lot would have inconsistent sounds.</p>
	    <p>We concluded that the region the rover was in was the rocky mountains.</p>
